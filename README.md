# Pharmacy_mgt_system

A Pharmacy Management System built with Python's tkinter and MySQL, allowing users to manage their inventory.

Python Functionality Learned and Used:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Created classes, objects, and methods to organize and structure the code.
tkinter GUI: Built a user-friendly interface with tkinter, using widgets, layouts, and event handling.
MySQL Database Connection: Used mysql.connector to connect to a MySQL database, execute SQL queries, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
Error Handling: Implemented try-except blocks to handle errors and exceptions, ensuring the program's stability and user experience.
Data Validation: Validated user input to prevent errors and ensure data integrity.
Functions and Modules: Organized code into reusable functions and modules, promoting modularity and maintainability.
String Formatting: Used f-strings and string formatting to display data in a readable format.
List and Dictionary Operations: Utilized lists and dictionaries to store and manipulate data.

Steps to Copy and Run the File:

Copy the Python script and save it as pharmacy_management_system.py.
Install the required libraries by running pip install tkinter mysql-connector-python.
Create a MySQL database and update the database connection settings in the script.
Run the script using Python (e.g., python pharmacy_management_system.py).
Follow the GUI prompts to interact with the Pharmacy Management System.
